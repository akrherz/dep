Our work is transitioning to use the projection EPSG:5070 for all GIS work, this
is the USGS CONUS Albers. 

Things to show
 - June 11, 2008 144.12 T/A !

So in review…the mean NRI slope length for all samples in V1 is 60.8m – 95%
198m.  when aggregated to townships: max slope length 95% = 311m

To be conservative, I would start at 311m as a flowpath length threshold,
then change to 198m to see how they matchup to the NRI results.

fp07060002 - flowpath number

Y - Y coordinate where sampled
ec3m070600 - elevation (in cm) where sampled
fplcm07060 - flowpath length (in cm)
GenLU07060 - generalized land use code
gSSURGO - soil map unit identifier
LU6_070600 - land use string
Management - management code
 
 
In the dbf file there is a "Management" field with values 1-5. These values
correspond to a C factor in IDEP1 management files (the tillage part of the
management file) and the correspondence changes based on the crop type since
C factors are an indication of the amount of residue on the surface at
planting. Higher C factor, higher erosion, lower residue cover.
