Local DEP modifications of WEPP
===============

The following code changes were made to the baseline WEPP model.

- Modification of water balance output file to trim size.
- Dump env output for all dates with precip or runoff.
- Modify the grph output file to only dump last year and OFE 1.
- Fix quasi-bug with SLR calculation always being 10x (#83).
- `Makefile` modification to allow dynamic fortran compiler setting.
- Increase `mxslp` (max number of slope points) from 20 to 100 (#158).
- Increase `mxtime` to 3000 to match WEPP 2022 and resolve numerical instability
with high resolution time precision?!?
- Change WEPP `.env` files to have explicit years (#183).
- [sedout.for] Make `.env` output single space delimited (#208).
