c     + + + PURPOSE + + +
c     Sets up the input to HDRIVE.  It gets the distance and time
c     location for depth calculations.  Converts ALPHA and rainfall
c     excess rates to internal length, for T from 0 to T(N), for N
c     between 1 and NS+1.
c
c     Called from IRS.

c     Changes:
c         1) Neither parameter is used (XTIME & NF).  Deleted
c            from RDAT, and it's call in IRS.
c         2) "do 10" & "do 20" loops combined.
c         3) Local variable CHEZYC deleted.
c         4) Since S is a REAL (not double precision), the line:
c                 if (s(i1).eq.0.d0) s(i1) = 1.d-10
c              was changed to:
c                 if (s(i1).eq.0.0) s(i1) = 1.e-10
c              and
c                 si(i) = 0.d0
c              was changed to:
c                 si(i) = 0.0
