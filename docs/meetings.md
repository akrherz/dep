  Cruse, Gelder, James, daryl, grad student
  - We have settled on 1616 HUC12s
  - Currently looking at a baseline rotation from 2008 to 2013 (6 yrs)
  - Discussion on handling the cropping data, daryl would like a simple code
    per field per year and then he'll build the rotations dynamically
  - Do we need to worry about difference between pasture and alfalfa ?
  - Grad student will do some tests to see if estimates statistically converge
    or not
  - Long discussion about how to do the breaks for the flow path, the initial
    break will be on slope, then soil, then management
  - daryl should email Laflen to see what he now has...
  - Need to get IDEPv2 running in realtime, even with the few watersheds
