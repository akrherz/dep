  - First iteration had 211,414 flowpaths
  - Brian is producing 1-5 management codes, which equates to tillage c-fact
  - Desired products for Tuesday Meeting
    1) State map of outputs for some days or many days
    2) Have some sort of comparison engine for IDEPv1 and IDEPv2 outputs
    3) Provide some highlights in the management changes

  - 16 HUC12s are currently missing cut-dems
  - Dave noted that some of the HUC12s have too many subcatchments
  - There is hope that the soil types have intrinsic slope characteristics, so
    they will break naturally
  - daryl should check the generalized slopes against individual cell to cell
    slopes
  - Brian would like to see the 1km precip displayed on the IDEPv2 map
  - The flowpaths are going to change as things are iterated, should I create
    some mechanism to account for these changes.  This could be ugly.
  - Will I need to version the output...
  - Dave's flow path computation takes 20 minutes per HUC12
  - There will be folks at the meeting on the 17th that are ignorant of the
    project, may have to rehash some things
  - Does the cutter code top terraces?
  - Need to ask the Kansas folks where their LIDAR data is!

  - We have settled on 1616 HUC12s
  - Currently looking at a baseline rotation from 2008 to 2013 (6 yrs)
  - Discussion on handling the cropping data, daryl would like a simple code
    per field per year and then he'll build the rotations dynamically
  - Do we need to worry about difference between pasture and alfalfa ?
  - Grad student will do some tests to see if estimates statistically converge
    or not
  - Long discussion about how to do the breaks for the flow path, the initial
    break will be on slope, then soil, then management
  - daryl should email Laflen to see what he now has...
  - Need to get IDEPv2 running in realtime, even with the few watersheds
