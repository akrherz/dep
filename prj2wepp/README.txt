This is an example command to create the WEPP input files names test* It also runs WEPP and saves the output files. 
Full pathnames should be used, relative paths have problems in some sections of the code:

./prj2wepp /home/jrf/weppbuild/prj2wepp/test/example/070801050405_17.prj test /home/jrf/weppbuild/prj2wepp/test/wepp yes

The wepp subdirectory contains files from the Windows install. The files in the wepp/wepp for the model executables should be 
set to the linux versions.
